# Line-Follower-Robot
A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot which is able to follow either a black or white line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a contrasting color. It is designed to move automatically and follow the made plot line. The robot uses several sensors to identify the line thus assisting the robot to stay on the track. The array of four sensor makes its movement precise and flexible. The robot is driven by DC gear motors to control the movement of the wheels. The Arduino Uno interface is used to perform and implement algorithms to control the speed of the motors, steering the robot to travel along the line smoothly.This project aims to implement the algorithm and control the movement of ther robot by proper tuning of the control parameters and thus achieve better performance.
